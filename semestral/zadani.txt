Relational algebra interpreter
==============================================================================================
This project aims to create an interpreter for relation algebra expression. Main source of data are CSV / JSON files. Additionally, SQL conversion capabilities are implemented
==============================================================================================
Features of the project:
- read CSV / JSON file and store it in memory as a variable
- write a variable to a CSV / JSON file
- evaluate relational algebra expressions on variables containing relational data
- convert relational algebra expressions to SQL
- Supported relational algebra operations:
  - set-set operations: union "∪", intersect "∩", except "\", cross "×"
  - set-boolean operations: is_subset "⊆", equals "=", is_proper_subset "⊂"
  - general joins: join "[rel1.col1 < rel2.col3]", left_semi_join "<condition]", right_semi_join "[condition>", left_anti_join "!<condition]", right_anti_join "![condition>"
  - natural joins (same order as general joins): "*", "<", ">", "!<", "!*>"
  - boolean operations: and "∧", or "∨", not "¬", xor "⊕", implies "⇒", equivalent "⇔", nand "⊼", nor "⊽"
  - projection: project "relation[col1, col3]"
  - selection: select "(condition)"
  - rename: rename "relation[col1 -> new_col1, col3 -> new_col3]"
- efficient memory representation of data - read files only when necessary and only the parts that are needed
- one data type all data - string
- nested expressions using () - Shunting-Yard algorithm
==============================================================================================
Example of usage:
animals1 = import "animals1.csv"
animals2 = import "animals2.csv"
nourishment = import "nourishment.csv"
temp = {{animals1 ∪ animals2} × nourishment}
print temp
sequelize tmp
export temp to "temp.csv"
==============================================================================================
How polymorphism is used:
- representation of data sources: table in CSV file, JSON data source, expressions - union, intersection, joins
  - all of them implement same interface and we can therefore read record by record from them
  - this enables memory-efficient reppresentation of data sources - we read only the parts of data that are needed
  - this also enables recursive evaluation of relational algebra expressions
  - on top of that, we can easily convert nested expression to SQL using this pattern
- boolean operations - and, or, not, primary boolean expressions
  - all of them implement same interface - this allows to recursively evaluate boolean expressions
- export formats: CSV, JSON, XML, PostgreSQL, ...
  - user is going to choose the format through GUI. Then in a factory method, correct exporter is going to be created and .export method on a common interface is going to be called
  - therefore, GUI does not have to worry about the format of the exported data
- abstract user interface - unified starting method and configuration based on CLI arguments parsed in main method.
  - this is going to be chosen on start of the app using CLI aguments
  - .run method is going to be called on a common interface from main method. This will start the user interface that has been chosen by the user
